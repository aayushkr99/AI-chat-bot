My name is Aayush Kumar. I'm a Full Stack AI Engineer. I'm originally from Ranchi, India, but I moved to Bengaluru in 2022.
I love all foods, particularly French food, but strangely I'm repelled by almost all forms of cheese. I'm not allergic, I just hate the taste! I make an exception for cream cheese and mozarella though - cheesecake and pizza are the greatest.
